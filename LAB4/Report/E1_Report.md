# SDP - Lab 4.1
The software after it has performed the reading of the binary file, it alloc the data structure, a vector V for the number readed that map the file address space, and 2 values, left and right for the position of the quicksort. The first thread is created by the main that will wait the end of the process.
The quicksort algorithm, based on the one provided, will reorder the vector between the 2 boundaries. Before perform 2 recursive call it create 2 copies of the main structure in order to procede to the next steps. After a check over the difference between the two indices and a size value provided by the user the recursive call is performed.
